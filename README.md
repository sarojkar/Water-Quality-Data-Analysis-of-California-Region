# Water-Quality-Data-Analysis-of-California-Region
The growing relevance of environmental monitoring and the crucial requirement to assess water quality have spurred the collecting of large datasets from numerous monitoring stations. This assignment is the first deliverable for our term project, which aims to evaluate a dataset that we got from the California Natural Resources Agency (CNRA) and derive relevant insights from it. In addition to providing answers to the topics at hand, our study will lay the groundwork for further research and in-depth analysis as we go with our term project.
The dataset we selected consists of many tables that each include crucial details about the environmental conditions and water quality at California monitoring sites. The tables include "Station," "Period of Record," "Lab Result," and "Field Result," providing a rich repository of data that can offer insights into the state of water quality, geographic variations, temporal trends, and much more. These tables capture details about monitoring stations, sample parameters, measurement results, and more. Analyzing this dataset can offer valuable insights into the state of water quality and environmental conditions in different locations and over time.
